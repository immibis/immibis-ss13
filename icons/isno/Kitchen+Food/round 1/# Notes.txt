Just a bunch of suggestions on what to put in I guess.

#########
EQUIPMENT
#########

OVEN
Cooks more than the microwave, but more slowly
Don't know about stuffing people in it since the chef already has the gibber

BLENDER/GRINDER
Refines some ingredients into different states
Hack/emagging it makes it able to grind any non-food item into dust (ala will it blend?)
